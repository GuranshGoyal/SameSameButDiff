# SameSameButDiff

## Overview
This repository aims to develop a model for **Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)** problems. The goal is to measure the degree of similarity between two text inputs, which is an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Usecases
- Information retrieval - Finding similar entries, blocking a particular type of comment for a YouTube video.
- Text summarization - In generating summaries, STS helps ensure that the summary retains the core meaning of the original text, even if the wording changes.
- Paraphrase detection - Quora may use it to better categorize the questions.
- Question answering - Various questions can be categorized to a single common to give an appropriate answer.
